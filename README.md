# Data-Exploration-Shiny-App

<https://drchachere.shinyapps.io/course-9_cp/>

Using air quality data from the R dataset airquality, this app is designed to simultaneously explore two features for each observation through a data visual.  With time plotted along the x-axis, the primary feature will be plotted along the y-axis.  The secondary feature is represented by color coding based on which quartile the observation falls in.
